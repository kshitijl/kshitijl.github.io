I used to not care about hardware.

I'm one of those typical programmers who care about algorithms and
software design. I like math and statically typed functional
languages, although I choose Python for most tasks. I couldn't care
less about the latest hardware or javascript framework. Trends are
beneath me!

But lately things have changed. Something big is happening. I'm not
overstating things when I say that the new hardware available is
different in kind, not just in degree. The end of Moore's law in the
traditional sense has stimulated creativity in hardware AND software.

Machine learning.

The massive success of machine learning in the last decade can be
summarized like so: use simple, general, computationally tractable
models on gigantic datasets. For example, neural networks are linear
classifiers connected in a graph, trained using gradient descent.

For me, this is the heart of what makes performance interesting again.
